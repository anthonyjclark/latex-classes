    The overarching goal of our lab is to develop novel methods for search and
    exploration. Specifically, we are interested in developing robot learning
    methods that enable robots to navigate any terrain. To construct devices
    that operate in rough, unstructured environments we design them with
    multiple modes of locomotion (e.g., wheeled, flight, walking, etc.). We
    refer to such robots as adaptive-locomotion robots; they are able to
    dynamically choose different methods of locomotion at runtime (see Figure 1
    for an example). An example application for such a device is aiding first
    responders looking for victims of a tornado, such as the one that affected
    our neighboring community (Joplin, Missouri) in 2011.
