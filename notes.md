Class Structure
- Identification
    + The file says that it is a LATEX2Îµ package or class, and gives a short description of itself.
- Preliminary declarations
    + Here the file declares some commands and can also load other files.  Usually these commands will be just those needed for the code used in the declared options.
- Options
    + The file declares and processes its options.
- More declarations
    + This is where the file does most of its work: declaring new variables, commands and fonts; and loading other files.
