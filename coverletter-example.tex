% Employees who are resigning or retiring should submit written notice to their supervisor and/or department at least two weeks prior to the last day of work. Resignations should include the reason for leaving the university and the employeeâ€™s requested date of resignation (termination date). If any use of vacation is involved, it should also state the day the employee is last planning on being present at work. If the employee wishes to use vacation time just prior to the resignation date, the request to do so should also be included so that the supervisor may approve or deny the request for vacation. Notice of the resignation and the PAF should be submitted as soon as possible well before the effective date of separation. The date of resignation/termination should be listed in the "Effective Date" field and the last day present at work noted in "Last Actual Day Worked" field on the PAF.

I am resigning from my position as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Missouri State University. My last day of work will be June 30, 2020. I am leaving my position because I have accepted another position at a different institution.

This was a wonderful job, I love my colleagues, and you have been a great leader for the department.
